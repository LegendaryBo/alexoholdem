/**
 * Alexo Holdem is a variant of
 *  Rhode Island Holdem where there are no suits,
 *  so there are 13 cards in a deck.
 * Hands are compared based on "High Card" value.
 *
 * Rhode Island Rules:
 *
 * (1) Each player pays an ante of 5 chips which is added to the pot.
 *      Both players initially receive a single card, face down;
 *      these are known as the hole cards.
 *
 * (2) After receiving the hole cards, the players participate in one
 *      betting round. Each playermay check (not placing anymoney in the
 *      pot and passing) or bet (placing 10 chips into the pot) if no
 *      bets have been placed. If a bet has been placed, then the player
 *      may fold (thus forfeiting the game along with any money they have
 *      put into the pot), call (adding chips to the pot equal to the
 *      last player’s bet), or raise (calling the current bet and making
 *      an additional bet). In Rhode Island Hold’em, the players are
 *      limited to three bets each per betting round. (A raise equals
 *      two bets.) In the ?rst betting round, the bets are equal
 *      to 10 chips.
 *
 * (3) After the ?rst betting round, a community card is dealt face up.
 *      This is called the ?op card. Another betting round take places
 *      at this point, with bets equal to 20 chips.
 *
 * (4) Following the second betting round, another community card is dealt face up.
This is called the turn card. A ?nal betting round takes place at this point, with
bets again equal to 20 chips.

 (5) If neither player folds, then the showdown takes place. Both players turn over
their cards. The player who has the best 3-card poker hand takes the pot. In the
event of a draw, the pot is split evenly.

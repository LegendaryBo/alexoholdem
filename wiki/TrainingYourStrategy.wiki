#summary How to have an infinite loop that keeps training a strategy and saving from time to time.

= Introduction =

First, we'll need to build or (much easier) [http://code.google.com/p/alexoholdem/downloads/list download] all of the indexes.  The LpSolve platform-specific libraries are required for `Optimizer` (I heard that Ubuntu comes with them, ideally this requirement should be removed).

We start by generating an abstraction using (for example) `AbstractionOptimizer.main()`,  you can pass in four arguments to set the desired abstraction size.  By default, you get:
{{{
    int  nHoleBuckets  =    48;
    char nFlopBuckets  =  1024;
    char nTurnBuckets  =  8192;
    char nRiverBuckets = 65535;
}}}
`char` is used to represent an `unsigned short` value, not anything character related. Note that `65535` (Character.MAX_VALUE) is the largest possible number of river buckets with the current implementation.

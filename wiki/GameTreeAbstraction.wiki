Glossary:
bucket: set of card sequences (within a betting round) that the computer will consider identical

The abstraction process consists of the following stages:
1) Pick number of buckets per round.
2) Given a set of betting sequences (within a betting round), and a desired number of buckets: place each card sequence into one of the buckets.


2) Pick a distance measure between card sequences (within the same round).
3) Use clustering algorithm (or some other method)


Card-sequences are abstracted, while betting-sequences are kept in full.
